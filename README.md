# Detection-of-Muscle-and-Bone-Regions-from-MRI-Images-with-Deep-Learning
This project uses the YOLOv8 model to detect and segment muscle and bone regions (humerus, scapula, and supraspinatus) in proton density-weighted MRI images. It addresses challenges like noise and intensity imbalances, improving medical image analysis.
